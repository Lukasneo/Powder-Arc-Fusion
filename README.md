With Powder Arc Fusion (PAF), we aim to revolutionize the world of metal additive manufacturing and make it accessible to a broad audience. While existing technologies like SLM (Selective Laser Melting) involve high costs,
complex systems, and limited availability,PAF is designed to offer robust, high-quality metal 3D printing at a fraction of the cost â€“ enabling prototyping,
small-series production, and creative projects.

PAF combines the advantages of arc-based energy delivery and powder bed technology, creating a new pathway for producing strong, functional metal parts.
By sharing our vision openly, we hope to empower makers, developers, and businesses to explore the potential of this technology.
